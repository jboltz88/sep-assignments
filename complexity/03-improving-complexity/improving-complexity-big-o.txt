1. The first loop to combine arrays gives us a time of n, but
   then the nested loops that put each element from the combined
   array into the sorted array give n^2. Therefore, n + n^2 gives
   us time of O(n^2).

2. Merge sort gives us time of O(n log n). We recursively divide the
   array into halves, which gives log n time, then the merging gives us
   n time. Therefore, n * log n gives O(n log n).


3. Bubble sort gives us space of O(1). We don't have to create any
   additional arrays, we just combine all the arrays and sort that
   combined array.
